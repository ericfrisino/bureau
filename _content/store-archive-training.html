<p>You have choices when it comes to your provider of workplace or hazardous materials/dangerous goods training. ICC Compliance Center should be your first choice.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the reasons why:</strong></p>
<ul style="circle">
	<li>We have been teaching the hazardous materials/dangerous goods regulations for more than 30 years.</li>
	<li>We have over 200 years of combined experience within the regulatory team alone. We bring our experience to each student and each class that we teach. You get practical examples and experiences that allow each student to relate to the material and better apply it at their workplace.</li>
	<li>We offer support, which is exclusive to ICC customers. You can call us with any question relating to GHS, OSHA, WHMIS, 49 CFR, TDG, IATA, and IMDG. We even have specialists on staff that can help with radioactives, biological substances, and hazardous wastes.</li>
	<li>We offer a variety of training courses. Come to one of our training facilities for a public class, have our instructor visit your facility for an on-site class, attend a webinar, or take an online training course. Webinars are a great alternative if cost or time is a concern.</li>
	<li>We offer courses for all levels, whether it is your first time taking training or you need refresher training. We also offer in-depth classes such as trainer training or classification.</li>
	<li><strong>Most importantly, we are the experts.</strong> We have been following the regulations for a long time. We have been preparing our staff and materials to make the transition from the old OSHA or WHMIS hazard communication system easier for everyone. We understand the challenge and the time that will be involved. And, we will be there to make it as painless and easy as possible.</li>
